# Automated Daily News Emailer


A Python script that fetches the latest news articles on a specified topic (e.g., "medical") from the News API and 
sends a curated list of articles to a specified email address. This project demonstrates the integration of web 
APIs and SMTP for automated information distribution.

## Key Features

- **News API Integration:** Automatically retrieves the latest news articles on a chosen topic from the News API.
- **Email Automation:** Sends an email containing a summary of the top 10 news articles, including their titles, 
descriptions, and URLs.
- **Secure Email Handling:** Utilizes environment variables for secure storage of sensitive information like email 
credentials.
- **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for failed API requests and email sending processes.

## Project Highlights

- **API Consumption:** Demonstrates the use of third-party APIs to consume and manipulate data.
- **Automation and Scheduling:** Automates daily tasks by combining Python scripting with email services.
- **Secure Practices:** Implements secure coding practices by managing sensitive data via environment variables.
- **Modular Code Design:** Follows a modular approach with separate scripts for handling API requests and sending 
emails, showcasing code organization and maintainability.

## Use Cases

- Daily news updates for healthcare professionals, researchers, or anyone interested in staying informed on a specific topic.
- Automated email distribution system for daily newsletters or information updates.
